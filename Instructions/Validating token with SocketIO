Now that we have something working with token validation, were going to switch it up a bit to validate in real time with
socketio

We're going to add a couple more lines of code to our socketio file

our socketio file now looks like this:

import io from "socket.io-client";

class Socket {
  url = "http://localhost:3001";
  client = null;
  constructor() {
    this.client = io.connect(this.url);
  }
  addToken(token) {
    this.client = io.connect(this.url);
  }
  removeToken() {
    this.client = io.connect(this.url);
  }
}

const instance = new Socket();

export default instance;

// Notice we created a class and added a couple more functions
 for adding and removing a token. We're going to habdle this next.

#Something to note, we also have to go back to our app,js file
and change or socket.on functions to instance.client.on functions, like so;

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.client.on("disconnect", () => {
      console.log("Socket Disconnected");
    });
    socket.client.on("call-new", (data) => {
      setCalls((draft) => {
        draft.calls.push(data);
      });
    });
    socket.client.on("enq", (data) => {
      setCalls((draft) => {
        const index = draft.calls.findIndex(
          ({ callSid }) => callSid === data.callSid
        );
        draft.calls[index].data.CallStatus = "enqueue";
      });
    });

    Next we're going to handle adding and removing tokens~
